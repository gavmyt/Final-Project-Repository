        <h1>LeBron James vs Michael Jordan: A Statistical Breakdown to find the GOAT</h1>
        <p id="goattalk">Who is the <b>GOAT?</b> (greatest of all time)</p>
        <p>That is one of the most debated questions in all of basketball. But when you ask that question, you are <i>truly</i> asking a simpler question:</p>
        <p>The King <font color="#552583"><b>LeBron</b></font> <font color="#ffb410"><b>James</b></font>, or His Airness <font color ="#CF093F"><b>Michael Jeffrey Jordan</b></font></p>
        <p>Between the two players, I think LeBron James has proven <b>time and time again</b> that he is the greatest basketball player of all time</p>
        <p>There are many statistics to prove that LeBron is the <b>more complete, versatile player,</b> and has a greater impact upon his <b>team's success</b></p>
